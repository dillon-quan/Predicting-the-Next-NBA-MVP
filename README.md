# Capstone-Project-1
### Summary
My first capstone project for springboard deals with handling NBA players' statline and using them to help predict the season MVPs. The idea is to randomly sample 1800 different statlines from the 2000 season till 2017 season with 100 statlines each where 1 statline will be the definitive MVP for that season and the rest are all non MVPs. After cleaning the initial dataset from kaggle, a classification model will be trained and tested using selected features.
